# encourage-bot-js
This is a basic JS Discord bot I made following Beau Carnes' tutorial (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-javascript-nodejs/). In a nutshell, the bot sends encouraging messages which can be customized by the user as well as random inspirational quotes. I have added a few minor additional features / improvements:
  - $list sends a descriptive title before listing the current encouragements
  - $responding responds to "on" or "true" to enable automatic responding to sad words. All other inputs will disable automatic responding.

To-do list:
  - Add $help command
  - General defensive programming
  - Make $del command more intuitive
